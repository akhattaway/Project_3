# Analysis
The number of new design requests that received mockups in February of 2024 was about the same as in 2023, with similar conversion so far for deals that came through the design process in February. 
This will likely increase as we get further into the month, allowing for the 30 day average sales cycle to round out for February’s incoming requests.

What is different if we’re not seeing the same growth in incoming design requests as we see in revenue growth? 

It looks like new orders (deals having passed through Mockups) are making up about 4% less of the overall revenue for the month, compared to last year. 

Order Size?
Product Type?
Reorders?

What did our incoming requests for design look like in 2023 look like compared to 2024?

Where did those requests come from?

What were the client types?

Were they existing or new business?
